# to_do_list

In this project I'm going to be creating a to-do list. This to do list is going to have different projects that the user can open up and see the different 'to-dos' in. This project is going to focus on my object creating with constructors or factories and really focus on being neat and tidy with my code using modules.

So much for being neat and tidy with my CODE!!!!!!
This project made me realize that I can NOT just skip out on learning factories and/or constructors. If you do, then you can't follow the SOLID rules of modules, and if you can't follow those rules you are bound to have tightly coupled functions. And if you have tightly coupled functions... oh my god I don't even want to talk about it. Everytime I created/updated a function in this project it created a problem in an existing function and it felt like plugging holes in a sinking ship. So here I am with working to-do list (pretty nice honestly) but it's just about the most complicated code possible. To expand or make any updates on this project would not be worth it at all.
It wasn't all for nothing though. I gained a lot of javascript knowledge, and I'm learning how to tackle problems in the code universe (very similar to mathematics but I'm learning what is possible/not possible with the language like looping an array) as well as important principles to abide by.
